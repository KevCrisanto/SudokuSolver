# SudokuSolver
This program solves a given Sudoku puzzle.

Currently it supports two strategies: [Simple markup](http://www.mathrec.org/sudoku/markup.html) and [Naked Pairs](http://www.sudokuwiki.org/naked_candidates). However, the program is designed so that if in the future we want to add more strategies we can easily do it.

I've included a [diagram](photos/FlowChart.png) in case you want to know how the program works.

### Usage
